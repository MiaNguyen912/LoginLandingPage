--LoginLandingPage-React--

Inside App.jsx there are two variables used to keep track of the login state: var isLoggedIn = true; var isRegistered = true;

if isLoggedIn = true: user already login and will be directed to welcome page to put in contact information
if isLoggedIn = false and isRegistered = true: login page appears
if isLoggedIn = false and isRegistered = false: register page appears
